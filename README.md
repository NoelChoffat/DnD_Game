# Welcome to the DnD Game!
## Background
We aim to create a DnD game using Unity.

## Code
We don't have any code yet.
We don't get paid.

## Basic Concept
We want to develop a Dungeons and Dragons game interface, which can be customized by the player.

The player should have the option to customize their health, stats, and items.

It's necessary to designate one player as the "Leader (Dungeon Master)" of the game. This individual is also responsible for creating the map, spawning enemies, and crafting the narrative that the players engage in.
